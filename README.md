# Time Series Prediction using TensorFlow
## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for time series prediction using the TensorFlow library. The model is built to forecast future values based on historical time series data. The notebook utilizes TensorFlow for building and training the neural network, while also making use of Matplotlib for visualization and NumPy for data manipulation.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the notebook:

* TensorFlow: [Installation instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip)
* Matplotlib: [Installation instructions](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/)
* NumPy: [Installation instructions](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)

## Dataset
The notebook uses a time series dataset, which will be generated in real-time.

## Usage
Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/TusharPatil-98/time_series_prediction_1.git
cd time_series_prediction_1
```
### Install the dependencies:
### Open the Jupyter notebook:
```
jupyter notebook Time_Series_Prediction.ipynb
```
Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the model and make predictions.
### Notebook Structure
* Data Preparation: Creating random time series data using sine, cosine and random methods of numpy.
* Model Building: Defining and training the TensorFlow model using LSTM layers.
* Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance on the test set.
* Prediction: Making predictions on future time points.
### Visualization
The notebook includes visualizations using Matplotlib to illustrate the training process, model predictions, and overall performance.
